## MathEngine
An engine for manipulating and exactly evaluating mathematical expressions and equations, written in C++

### How it works
Expressions/equations are represented as abstract syntax trees internally.
These trees are then manipulated dynamically using a database of identities loaded from a text file.

### DISCLAMER
I am not a mathematician, nor a math major, nor substantially interested in mathematics apart from computer science.

Thus, this project is limited to my limited understanding of mathematics. 

If you see a flaw in my understanding that is relevant to this project, let me know!
